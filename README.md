                    _______ HQ_Home________

HQ_Home is a hobby project of mine, it aim to put all of the knowledge
I've gained from the past year of selflearning to code.

The idea of this project is to serve a userbase web-application without
any third party service. Database, authentication, deploying, hosting,
scaling, maintain, etc. will be managed by my onw knowledge and hardware.
